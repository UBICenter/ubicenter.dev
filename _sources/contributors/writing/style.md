# Writing style

## Favor active over passive voice

Instead of:
> The poverty rate is cut in half by the reform.

Use:
> The reform cuts the poverty rate in half.

## Use objective terms

Instead of:
> Reform A is better for inequality than Reform B.

Use:
> Reform A lowers inequality more than Reform B.
